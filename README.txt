  This landing page is developed with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, 
using Live Server - a plugin for VS Code to launch a development 
local Server with live reload feature, this way to be able to see
the result is necessary to load the page using it.

  About why i haven't done the "Reference" section's functionality
and what i've managed to do, i've written in "index.html" document
in a comment on the row 213
